Hey, I'm a student at **PES University** doing my undergrad in Computer Science and Engineering, working towards a specialization in Machine Intelligence and Data Science. I like spending my free time solving problems on HackerRank, watching shows on Netflix and writing article on my website [hello ML](https://helloml.org).
