Hey, I'm a student at **PES University** doing my undergrad in Computer Science and Engineering, working towards a specialization in Machine Intelligence and Data Science. I like spending my free time solving problems on HackerRank, watching shows on Netflix and writing articles on [hello ML](https://helloml.org).  

Check [this](https://helloml.org/internship-guidelines-at-hello-ml/) out if you're interested in contributing to **hello ML** by sharing your knowledge and experience.
